I"£<p>Recently, I worked on Google Big query integration. I found it bit difficult get it working quickly to make all setup for integrating Google API since documentation is also bit verbose.</p>

<p>So, I would like to share that with you all. This post will take you through integrating Google Big query integration in Ruby application.</p>

<p>First you will need to enable API in google compute console, then generate secret key if you havenâ€™t.
Here is google big query API service that I have written. Currently, It only has API integrated for fetching data from google big query.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/pandurang90/cec29ae85acea02609a028a6ed8e66c4.js"></script>

<p>Then call it with,</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="n">big_query_service</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">GoogleBigQueryService</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">query</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">big_query_service</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">execute_query</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Here is more info about Big Query API,  <a href="https://developers.google.com/apis-explorer/#p/bigquery/v2/">https://developers.google.com/apis-explorer/#p/bigquery/v2/</a></p>

<p>One can also use command-line tool, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/gcloud-compute/">https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/gcloud-compute/</a>
Though CLI tool gives you data in required format unlike in APIs it returns data in bit confused format but itâ€™s also not intended to be an API, since formatting and output are subject to change.</p>
