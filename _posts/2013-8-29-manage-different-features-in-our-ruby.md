Manage features in Rails application with feature_flags
You must have faced situation while developing to turn off/on some features in your rails application. 

So here is ruby gem feature_flags that provides this functionality.Using this we can maintain different features in rails application.
So to add gem in your Rails application,
Add this line to your applicationâ€™s Gemfile:
{% highlight ruby %}
gem 'feature_flags'
{% endhighlight %}
then run command
{% highlight bash %}
rails generate feature_flags:install
{% endhighlight %}
this will generate 3 files,
1) initializer file in config/initializer/feature_flags.rb
2) migration file for Feature model
3) Feature.rb
also it add routes in your rails application
{% highlight ruby %}
resources :features
{% endhighlight %}
 then do
{% highlight ruby %}
rake db:migrate
{% endhighlight %}
In feature_flags.rb initializer file you can mention which layout to use for view
{% highlight ruby %}
FeatureFlags.configure do |config|
  config.layout = "application" 
end
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight ruby %}
FeatureFlags.enabled?(:feature_name) To check whether feature is enabled or not 

FeatureFlags.enable_all                   To enable all features in your app.

FeatureFlags.disable_all                  To disable all features in your app.

FeatureFlags.set_disabled(:feature_name)  To disable feature in your app.

FeatureFlags.create_and_enable(:feature_name)  To create and enable feature

FeatureFlags.enable(feature_name)         To enable feature
{% endhighlight %}
If you want to generate views then use,
{% highlight bash %}
rails generate feature_flags:views
{% endhighlight %}
It will also solve branching problem in rails application, as we merge branches having different features and then solving conflicts in it.so feature_flags makes it easy, you just turn on/off that feature in app.
for example,
{% highlight ruby %}
if FeatureFlags.enabled?(:feature_name1)
   # your code for feature_name1
end
{% endhighlight %}

Here are some screenshots, 
main index view( /feature_flags )

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/feature_flags.png)

Adding new feature page,
